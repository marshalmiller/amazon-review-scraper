"4.0 out of 5 stars Felt better after eating, but","I felt more energetic and stronger after eating small amounts of carbs...I was fuller and had more energy, but I developed more skin tags on my neck. The skin tags are likely insulin resistance, which is disappointing...I eat far less whole food sugar, almost scratch made meals consistently, and almost zero snack sugar...certainly less than most people. I think my conflict is more the quality of food being less natural than this protocol being a problem along with my age and inactivity. At 54, I just don't move like I did when 5 years younger so I don't burn that quick sugar. Given the modern state of cheaply made food, like store bread, this didn't work for me. I do occasionally make my own white bread and whole wheat bread of what I think is extremely high quality ingredients even if comparing relatively speaking to items on the grocery store shelf. the bread dough is beautiful in texture....I don't see an increase in skin tags when making and consuming homemade breads. It's difficult to put all aspects of this plan together and I guess would be a process over time that is somewhat dependent on quality whole food.","14 Feb 2024","","","Yes","Snapples","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars This + therapy cured my eating disorder of 15 years","Megan Hansen has created such an incredible programme. If you’ve ever heard talk of ‘intuitive eating’ and wondered wtf that actually looks like. This is it. She combines science with empowerment so that you learn what it looks like to actually care for your body. I will never diet again, I will never cut out a food again for weight loss, I will never miss out or go without again. 15 years of disordered eating was conquered with this programme. Therapy got to the core of my issues, Megan Hansen and Metabolism Makeover showed me step by step HOW to eat so that I could feel my best. 2 years later and no bingeing, purging, diet cycling, and my weight has continuously dropped and is still dropping, even with a pregnancy within those 2 years. It’s so hard to trust programmes after such a saturated diet industry making us feel like we’re the problem. This book teaches us that I didn’t fail the diet, the diet failed me. This will be the last book, the last programme, the last person you turn to to heal your relationship with food and your body. Because this book gives YOU back that power. Invest in yourself. Buy the book. Do the programme. Be like me. Cured and telling everyone about it. Because there ARE options out there. You CAN feel good. There IS a better way. This is that way.","10 Jul 2023","","","Yes","Marissa","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Follow Megan’s Advice For A Better Life!","I started following Megan on IG 3 yrs ago.  I lurked, I listened.  I followed her ideas, I stopped for a bit and went back.  I then engaged more seriously, paid for her program and got more serious since Jan 22.  This year I upped my game further following continued teachings.  I am 56, suffering Menopause weight gain and symptoms and was feeling lost and hopeless in many aspects of life.  This is not a diet, it’s a way to empower yourself to live a healthy fulfilling life and manage food and your health effectively.  I have lost 10+ lbs (I don’t weigh often), am gaining muscle, found energy and joy in life, rebounded at work which resulted in both raises and a top performance trip.  I am an overall “C student” to her program, applying myself more seriously this year.  If I can have this success as your average, run of the mill, overweight, sedentary, desk job, empty nester - anyone can!!  It’s the way to live your life in a positive manner.  Her book allows her to bring her approach to many more people and I couldn’t be happier for her and all who will gain from this.  I have followed Megan since before her divorce and before her daughter was born.  I feel like a proud Momma (she has an awesome Mom - doesn’t need me!), she is the real deal who has applied all her own leanings to achieve her success and has a passion for helping others.  She’s authentic and relatable.  Buy this book and buckle down for the long run - it’s what you need!!","07 May 2023","","","Yes","lindsm66","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars FUN AND FREEDOM!!  The Metabolism Makeover is a breath of fresh air and a sustainable lifestyle!!!","CHAPTER 8 alone is worth buying this book! I couldn’t wait to get my hands on The Metabolism Makeover by Megan Hansen and it’s not just because my story is highlighted on page 57! It’s because this program changed my life…. really! I have struggled with my weight and my relationship with food since I was a preteen.  I am a health educator and have helped students learn about keeping their bodies healthy and making good decisions for years but couldn’t get it right for myself until I was introduced to Megan Hansen’s THE METABOLISM MAKEOVER!  I have been a part of Megan’s Metabolism Makeover online community for over 2 years.  This book is like a handy guide to her program but MORE! She writes authentically and reading this book feels like you are talking to a friend who cares and wants to help you succeed….finally! The program is science based, easily broken into the six pillars of our metabolic Ecosystem (yes a metabolic ecosystem)… we are talking RELATABLE science! Megan gives the reader a plan or rather a method to follow one step at a time to fit into THEIR  lifestyle. Megan also understands that to fix our metabolisms runs much deeper than food, movement or exercise.  We must address sleep, stress, gut health and of course our mindset! I’ll say it again, Chapter 8 alone is worth the read! I am so excited for you, the reader, to get your hands on this masterpiece and begin to change your relationship with food but so so so much more!!! Congratulations, you’ve made a great decision!

"5.0 out of 5 stars Super Approachable, Easy Tips to Implement","If you want all the science behind why your metabolism does what it does, and what you can do to optimize it this is the book for you. Written with an approachable vibe like you are two friends chatting over martinis, Megan walks you through all things metabolism. Sleep, food (PHFF is your BFF, IYKYK), gut health, movement, mindset - all things impact weight more holistically than just calories in and calories out. Unlike other diet books, fads, trends, programs, and whatever else is out there, the Metabolism Makeover approach gives you tiny, bite sized steps and habits to implement right away. What's brilliant about this book is that it isn't an all or nothing approach - and I know that I give up right away when told to make drastic changes. Megan gives easy suggestions like increasing protein portions at one meal, or picking one part of your day to add in a walk to slowly make changes to better your health. And the best part? While this isn't a dry science textbook, all of these methods are backed by science! I can't speak highly enough of the way Megan approaches health and food - she has an incredibly authentic voice and story that is woven throughout her writing. This book is filled with action items (we love to see it), bits of wisdom (always needed), and the tough love you need to make changes in your life (admittedly much needed, too).","16 May 2023","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Never “diet” again! Forever improve your life","Have you tried the “Eat less, Move more” approach to health and never seen lasting results?  Once you read Megan’s book, Metabolism Makeover, you will understand why any “diet” you tried before never worked. Metabolism Makeover is not another diet book, it’s a fun and easy read that will guide you through how the Metabolic Pillars work to support your health, why each pillar matters to your overall health, and how they are all connected.  This is not a “program” you can fail at, it’s a beautiful and adaptable way of living your best life.  A year ago I learned this information from Megan’s Metabolism Makeover online course and my life is forever changed for the better. I only wish I had learned all this sooner! Megan is a registered dietitian who had also tried the “typical” diet approaches we’ve all been told over the years and realized these “diet” plans never work long term for our health. She took a deep dive into the science of our bodies and minds to learn what REALLY works and put it all into this book to share with all of us so we can enjoy long and healthy lives!  Add this to your cart now and start reading the book that will change your life.","05 May 2023","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XI6-LuxaL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Anne","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally a weight loss method that doesn’t consume your brain and time!","This book is fantastic! This is a must read if you want to finally shed some pounds for good or be a healthier version of yourself. Megan is a dietician by trade but she is also an experimenter and teaches us all how to experiment with our own bodies and to get back to trusting ourselves with what our bodies need and not what the diet industry or even modern medicine says it needs to lose weight and even discover ways to heal. Megan has written this book like a supportive friend who’s been in your shoes helping every step of the way without judgment! The biggest difference in this book compared to others like it on weight loss or improving health is the focus on the whole person. Since it focuses on the whole person you may find out that what you are eating or even how you are exercising is not what is holding you back from reaching your weight loss goals. This book has real life scenarios and resources to help you get started and succeed. I have highlighted and bookmarked page after page in this book. It is definitely not one that will just collect dust on the shelf after reading!","12 May 2023","","","Yes","marley olejnik","","Metabolism Makeover: Ditch the Diet, Train Your Brain, Drop the Weight for Good","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1736357980/?reviewerType=all_reviews"
